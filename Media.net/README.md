- Given the list of money you either gave or took from your friends. Find the name of friend whom you have to pay max amount. If you have taken money then value will be positive or if you have given money value will be negative. If more than 1 friend have max amount then print the name of friend who achieved equal to or more than max amount the earliest. (this is available on GeeksForGeeks)

- You are given a list of airline tickets where tickets[i] = [fromi, toi] represent the departure and the arrival airports of one flight. Reconstruct the itinerary in order and return it. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from "JFK", thus, the itinerary must begin with "JFK". If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string.
For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary. You must use all the tickets once and only once. (this is available on LeetCode)


- There are many people who believe that the earth is flat and NASA is a scam. They call themselves Flat Earthers. They were already worried that the 6 feet social distancing rule might push some people out of the earth. Now, they decided to think about a new issue. Since the earth is flat ( or so they think), let's imagine it as an infinite 2D grid. They have the coordinates of certain points which are orange zones and have some COVID-19 cases reported. Now each day the orange zones become more fatal. After d days, all the locations within a euclidean distance of d of a particular orange zone can be affected by this zone.
They know N orange zones, each of whose coordinates are given by (A[i][0], A[i][1]). Now, a location is considered a red zone if it is affected by at least B orange zones. You need to find the first day at which the first red zone is reported. (this is available on InterviewBit)
